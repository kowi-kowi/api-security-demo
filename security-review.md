- Input validation in DTOs ✅
- Safe error handling (no stack traces) ✅

## Planned security milestones
- JWT authentication + RBAC (Day 2)
- Object-level authorization (IDOR prevention)
- Audit trail for workflow transitions
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- CI pipeline enforcing security checks
